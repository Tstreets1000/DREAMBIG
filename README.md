# Big Poppa Code React Starter Kit
This Starter Kit is being created for New Web Developers that want to get started with react

Most people use a CLI Tool like Vue-Cli or Create React App and no idea what these things are doing

The goal of this is for it to be a tool that let's you learn JS at a new level because you have access to
everything under the hood and no opinionated set up

I will base all my tutorials on this Starter Kit.
